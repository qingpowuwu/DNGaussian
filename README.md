## Installation

Tested on Ubuntu 18.04, CUDA 11.3, PyTorch 1.12.1

``````
conda env create --file environment.yml
conda activate dngaussian

cd submodules
git clone git@github.com:ashawkey/diff-gaussian-rasterization.git --recursive
git clone https://gitlab.inria.fr/bkerbl/simple-knn.git
pip install ./diff-gaussian-rasterization ./simple-knn
``````

If encountering installation problem of the `diff-gaussian-rasterization` or `gridencoder`, you may get some help from [gaussian-splatting](https://github.com/graphdeco-inria/gaussian-splatting) and [torch-ngp](https://github.com/ashawkey/torch-ngp).


## Evaluation

### LLFF

1. Download LLFF from [the official download link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/128yBriW1IG_3NJ5Rp7APSTZsJqdJdfc1). or https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arenagrenade/llff-dataset-full?resource=download

2. Generate monocular depths by DPT:

   ```bash
   cd dpt
   python get_depth_map_for_llff_dtu.py --root_path $<dataset_path_for_llff> --benchmark LLFF

   wget https://github.com/isl-org/MiDaS/releases/download/v3/dpt_hybrid_384.pt -P /root/.cache/torch/hub/checkpoints/
   cd dpt
   python get_depth_map_for_llff_dtu.py --root_path /home/qingpo.wuwu1/Project_2_3dGS_Cars/1_Ours/DNGaussian/data/nerf_llff_data --benchmark LLFF
   ```
* 这个代码会保存 depth.png 成 16 bits (i.e， 像素的最大值能到 65535，如果是 8 bits 的话最大值能到 255) =》因为 This larger range allows for more precise depth information to be stored in the image. While an 8-bit image can only represent 256 different depth levels, a 16-bit image can represent 65536 different depth levels.

3. Start training and testing:

   ```bash
   # for example
   bash scripts/run_llff.sh data/llff/fern output/llff/fern ${gpu_id}
   ```



### DTU

1. Download DTU dataset

   - Download the DTU dataset "Rectified (123 GB)" from the [official website](https://roboimagedata.compute.dtu.dk/?page_id=36/), and extract it.
   - Download masks (used for evaluation only) from [this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Yt5T3LJ9DZDiHbtd9PDFNHqJAd7wt-_E/view?usp=sharing).


2. Organize DTU for few-shot setting

   ```bash
   bash scripts/organize_dtu_dataset.sh $rectified_path
   ```

3. Format

   - Poses: following [gaussian-splatting](https://github.com/graphdeco-inria/gaussian-splatting), run `convert.py` to get the poses and the undistorted images by COLMAP.
   - Render Path: following [LLFF](https://github.com/Fyusion/LLFF) to get the `poses_bounds.npy` from the COLMAP data. (Optional)


4. Generate monocular depths by DPT:

   ```bash
   cd dpt
   python get_depth_map_for_llff_dtu.py --root_path $<dataset_path_for_dtu> --benchmark DTU
   ```

5. Set the mask path and the expected output model path in `copy_mask_dtu.sh` for evaluation. (default: "data/dtu/submission_data/idrmasks" and "output/dtu") 

6. Start training and testing:

   ```bash
   # for example
   bash scripts/run_dtu.sh data/dtu/scan8 output/dtu/scan8 ${gpu_id}
   ```



### Blender

1. Download the NeRF Synthetic dataset from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/128yBriW1IG_3NJ5Rp7APSTZsJqdJdfc1?usp=sharing).

2. Generate monocular depths by DPT:

   ```bash
   cd dpt
   python get_depth_map_for_blender.py --root_path $<dataset_path_for_blender>
   ```

3. Start training and testing:

   ```bash
   # for example
   # there are some special settings for different scenes in the Blender dataset, please refer to "run_blender.sh".
   bash scripts/run_blender.sh data/nerf_synthetic/drums output/blender/drums ${gpu_id}
   ```


## Reproducing Results
Due to the randomness of the densification process and random initialization, the metrics may be unstable in some scenes, especially PSNR.


### Checkpoints and Results
You can download our provided checkpoints from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1V8XGg1MXJDb-bK3NAEo5Gw2GLLByF7FM?usp=sharing). These results are reproduced with a lower error tolerance bound to keep aligned with this repo, which is different from what we use in the paper. This could lead to higher metrics but worse visualization.


### MVS Point Cloud Initialization

If more stable performance is needed, we recommend trying the dense initialization from [FSGS](https://github.com/VITA-Group/FSGS).

Here we provide an example script for LLFF that just modifies a few hyperparameters to adapt our method to this initialization:

```bash
# Following FSGS to get the "data/llff/$<scene>/3_views/dense/fused.ply" first
bash scripts/run_llff_mvs.sh data/llff/$<scene> output_dense/$<scene> ${gpu_id}
```

However, there may still be some randomness.

For reference, the best results we get in two random tests are as follows:

| PSNR   | LPIPS  | SSIM (SK)   |  SSIM (GS)   |
| ------ | ------ | ----- | ----- |
| 19.942 | 0.228  | 0.682 | 0.687 |

where GS refers to the calculation originally provided by 3DGS, and SK denotes calculated by sklearn which is used in most previous NeRF-based methods.


## Customized Dataset
Similar to Gaussian Splatting, our method can read standard COLMAP format datasets. Please customize your sampling rule in `scenes/dataset_readers.py`, and see how to organize a COLMAP-format dataset from raw RGB images referring to our preprocessing of DTU.
